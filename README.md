# 🫁 Lung Cancer Stage Detection 🔍🧠  
**"Detect. Classify. Save Lives."**

---

## 🧭 Introduction

Lung cancer remains one of the deadliest cancers worldwide — but **early, accurate detection can change everything**. This project is a deep learning-powered approach to **classifying lung cancer stages using CT scan images**, making diagnosis faster, smarter, and potentially life-saving.

Whether for research, diagnostics, or real-world deployment, this system is designed with **impact** in mind.

## 💡 What This Project Does

- 📤 **Uploads CT scan images** of the patient
- 🧠 **Processes and analyzes the image** via a trained CNN model
- 🏷️ **Predicts the cancer stage**, classified into:
  - **Stage I** – Normal case  
  - **Stage II** – Benign case  
  - **Stage III** – Indolent case  
  - **Stage IV** – Malignant case
- 👤 **Displays patient name, image, and result** on a dynamic result tab
